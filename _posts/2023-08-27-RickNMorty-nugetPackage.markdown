# RickNMorty API NuGet Package

A .NET library for easy integration with the Rick and Morty API. This library provides services to interact with characters, locations, and episodes from the "Rick and Morty" universe.
### Wrapper API around the following  [API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/)
# Installation

```
or

```bash

```

# Usage
## Installation
First, install the NuGet package in your project.

## Register Services
In your application's startup or configuration class, register the services provided by the RickNMorty.API library.


```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using RickNMorty.API; // Replace with actual namespace

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddScoped<ICharacterService, CharacterService>();
    services.AddScoped<ILocationService, LocationService>();
    services.AddScoped<IEpisodeService, EpisodeService>();
}
```

## Using Services
Now you can inject and use the services in your application components.

## Character Service
### Getting All Characters
Retrieve a list of all characters from the "Rick and Morty" universe.

```csharp

    {
        _characterService = characterService;
    }

    public void FetchAllCharacters()
    {
        var allCharacters = _characterService.GetAll();
        // Process the characters
    }
}
```

    }

    public void FetchCharacterById(int characterId)
    {

    }
}
```

## Location Service

public class MyService

    private readonly ILocationService _locationService;

    public MyService(ILocationService locationService)
    {
        _locationService = locationService;
    }

    public void FetchAllLocations()
    {
        var allLocations = _locationService.GetAll();
        // Process the locations
    }
}
```
### Getting a Location by ID

    public MyService(ILocationService locationService)
    {
        _locationService = locationService;
    }

    public void FetchLocationById(int locationId)
    {
        var location = _locationService.GetItemsByID(locationId);
        // Process the location
    }
}
```

## Episode Service
### Getting All Episodes

    public MyService(IEpisodeService episodeService)
    {
        _episodeService = episodeService;
    }

    public void FetchAllEpisodes()
    {
        var allEpisodes = _episodeService.GetAll();
        // Process the episodes
    }
}
```

### Getting an Episode by ID

```csharp
try
{
    var character = _characterService.GetCharacterByID(characterId);

{
    // Handle the exception here
}
